#curly brackets to be used only when you define dictionary or set
#list add append 
#tupple concatination
#set add() function
#in Dict add directly by DICT("add")
#for data analytics set is used
#SET.remove() will give error if value was not there
#SET.discard() is a safer option for it
#Clear set with NAME_OF_SET.clear()
